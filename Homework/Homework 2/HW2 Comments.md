#### Overall

This is good work. The answers for Problems 1-4 are generally correct, but could use a bit more elaboration in terms of memory. Problems 5 and 7 have some minor errors, as noted in the specific comments. Finally, Problem 6 appears to be missing. If that's incorrect, let me know.

#### Correctness

As mentioned above, 1-4 are good but rely too much on words like "equal," which are ambiguous when we're talking about how pointers, values, and memory. In 5, the solution only works by the caprices of dictionary auto-sorting; it's not really doing what it's supposed to. It's close though!

#### Readability

This was great. No issues.

#### Documentation

Generally good, modulo the comments about 1-4 (to the extent that's a documentation issue).

#### Efficiency

Problem 3 could be more efficient. See my specific comments.

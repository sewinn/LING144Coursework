#### Overall

This is very good work. It could be excellent with comments, better variable names, and a completed Problem 5. Overall though, it's well done.

#### Correctness

The incomplete Problem 5 is the only problem here. Otherwise it's great.

#### Readability

Very clear for the most part. Just those variable names need changing in.

#### Documentation

Add more comments. One every few lines.

#### Efficiency

Excellent. The methods for finding the first vowel and dealing with punctuation were great choices.

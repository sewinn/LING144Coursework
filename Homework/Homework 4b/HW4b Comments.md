#### Overall

This is a very good response. Specifically, the solutions to 5-6 are excellent, and while the output of 7 is correct, the solution doesn't quite conform to the assignment.

#### Correctness

In Problem 7, the regex does split the sentences, but it doesn't do so by looking for ends of lines. This makes the last part of the problem much easier, because you don't have each line in two parts to be rejoined.

#### Readability

Excellent.

#### Documentation

Also excellent.

#### Efficiency

Good, though see my specific comments on Problem 5 for an equivalent, simpler solution.

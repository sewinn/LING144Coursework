#### Overall

This is a good start. Since the assignment's split up this week, I've broken this week's comments down by problem instead of criteria.

#### Problem 1

This is good. If you really wanted to split up the control and the raising cases, you could do another search looking for dummy subjects in the matrix clause to identify those verbs.

#### Problem 2

This is a good start. Sorry you didn't overcome your technical issues.

#### Problem 3

This is also a good start. Take a look at the notes from the final section to see one way to tackle this.

#### Problem 4

Content-wise these annotations are great, but the coding is inconsistently formatted.

#### Problem 5

Some questions on your codebook:

- Sometimes production companies appear in the credits. Should they be marked as staff, or only individual people?
- If you're just marking anything with a question mark, how does it add information versus just searching for sentences ending in questions marks (which a machine can do)? Make sure your tags add information.

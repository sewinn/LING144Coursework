#### Overall

This is very good work, and excellence is within reach. Are you two feeling more confident? You should be.

#### Correctness

Problems 1-3 are basically flawless in terms of correctness. Problems 4-5 don't quite work, and I it looks like it's because of confusion about what the class is supposed to do. In this case, when you make a new instance of this class, you want to be able to give it a path, and the new instance will store the frequency data for the file at that location. So your init statement will take the path, and store a bunch of attributes, like self.path maybe, but especially self.frequencies and self.freqtable, so that you can pull that information out later. The class itself is just a prototype for the instances of the class.

#### Readability

Good. Very clear overall, with a couple points where naming some variables would making things easier.

#### Documentation

Excellent.

#### Efficiency

Excellent. Nicely done on Problem 2.

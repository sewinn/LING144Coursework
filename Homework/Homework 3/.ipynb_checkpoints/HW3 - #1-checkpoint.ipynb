      "Your job in the first problem is simply to load the file, and tokenize it. The relevant files to choose are in the data/SampleTexts directory. There are two ways of saying where that is. There is the short or relative path, which is given from where this notebook is (homework/HW3). In such paths, to go up, one uses two periods. So, \"..\" means the parent of HW3, which is homework, and \"../..\" is the github repo root.\n",
      "\n",
      "Use relative paths to open one of the files in SampleTexts. Write another function that reads through the text, line by line, and tokenizes it. Since we are going for phonemes, you can ignore any tokens not in the CMU dictionary, including punctuation. Your tokenizer should examine the CMU dictionary and return a list of tokens, where each token is the CMU pronunciation for that word. If the word has multiple pronunciations, choose the first. If the word isn't in the dictionary, just ignore it."
